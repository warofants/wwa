## Eciton (army ant)

- 200 different species

- Living nest with millions of ants

- While on a hunt, some for lines up to 100 meters long

- Killing & dismembering every insect or small vertebra they encounter

- The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500K animals per day

## Neotropical Army Ants specialize in hunting and consuming insects, especially

- Termites

- Wasps

- Ants

## Wasps

- bigger and stronger than individual ants, will kill a few, but quickly overwhelmed

- If queen survives, army ants steals larvae and quickly devour, no recovery

## Army ants

- When they discover another colony, they immediately attack

- Act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective

- Overwhelm with numbers before victim colony can mount effective defense

- army ants don’t fight army ants, if encountered, they ignore and move away

## Types of army ants

- Army and soldier

- Bullet ant

- Giant Amazonian ant

## Pheidole desertorum defense

- Immediately evacuate nest when they notice army ants

- Carry as many larvae as they can in order to return and rebuild after attack

## Pheidole obtusospinosa defense

- Worker classes have big square heads

- Used to block entrances to nest when army ants show up

- Attackers give up after a while

## Leaf cutter ants (Atta cephalotes)

- largest and most complex societies

- Nests are several meters deep and harbor millions with a division of labor

- Compartments consist of:

  - Refuse

  - Brood chambers

  - Fungus gardens

- Soldiers are 100x larger than workers, sole purpose to defend against army ants

- Nemesis is Nomamyrmex esenbeckii

## Nomamyrmex Esenbeckii

- Diet consist of larvae of other ants

- Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier class

- Short, bulky appendages

- Heavy armor

- Only species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leaf cutters

- When they find a leaf cutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column

- Attackers swarm leaf cutters and try to sting to death in a mob

- Still superior in numbers

- If leaf cutters do not repel army ants or barricade entrances, army ants swarm and overrun everything, steal larvae

## Leaf cutter defense

- Enter crisis mode

- Soldiers swarm to site of attack

- “Front line” develops, up to a few meters wide and one meter deep with ants

- Soldiers go head-to-head, try to cut off heads

- Smaller leaf cutter workers try to help by ripping legs of enemies

- Workers create barricades to seal off as many entrances as possible to secure
