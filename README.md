# World War of Ants

- Eciton (army ant)
	- 200 different species
	- Living nest with millions of ants
	- While on a hunt, some for lines up to 100 meters long
	- Killing & dismembering every insect or small vertebra they encounter 
	- The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500K animals per day
- Neotropical Army Ants specialize in hunting and consuming insects, especially:
	- Termites
	- Wasps
	- Ants
- Wasps
	- bigger and stronger than individual ants, will kill a few, but quickly overwhelmed 
	- If queen survives, army ants steals larvae and quickly devour, no recovery 
- Army ants
	- When they discover another colony, they immediately attack
	- Act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective
	- Overwhelm with numbers before victim colony can mount effective defense
	- army ants don’t fight army ants, if encountered, they ignore and move away
- Types of army ants
	- Army and soldier
	- Bullet ant
	- Giant Amazonian ant
- Pheidole desertorum defense:
	- Immediately evacuate nest when they notice army ants
	- Carry as many larvae as they can in order to return and rebuild after attack	
- Pheidole obtusospinosa defense:
	- Worker classes have big square heads
	- Used to block entrances to nest when army ants show up
	- Attackers give up after a while
- Leaf cutter ants (Atta cephalotes)
	- largest and most complex societies 
	- Nests are several meters deep and harbor millions with a division of labor
	- Compartments consist of:
		- Refuse	
		- Brood chambers
		- Fungus gardens
	- Soldiers are 100x larger than workers, sole purpose to defend against army ants
	- Nemesis is Nomamyrmex esenbeckii 
- Nomamyrmex Esenbeckii
	- Diet consist of larvae of other ants
	- Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier class
	- Short, bulky appendages
	- Heavy armor
	- Only species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leaf cutters
	- When they find a leaf cutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column
	- Attackers swarm leaf cutters and try to sting to death in a mob
	- Still superior in numbers
	- If leaf cutters do not repel army ants or barricade entrances, army ants swarm and overrun everything, steal larvae
- Leaf cutter defense:
	- Enter crisis mode
	- Soldiers swarm to site of attack
	- “Front line” develops, up to a few meters wide and one meter deep with ants
	- Soldiers go head-to-head, try to cut off heads
	- Smaller leaf cutter workers try to help by ripping legs of enemies
	- Workers create barricades to seal off as many entrances as possible to secure
- Types of battles
	- Skirmishes	
		- Smaller, quicker battles
	- Raids
		- Larger, longer, and more complex battles
	- Invasions
		- Full-out invasions, and take-overs of other colonies
